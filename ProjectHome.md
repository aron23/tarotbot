TarotBot is an open source framework for tarot readings on Android devices with switchable card decks and interpretations.

There is also a novel interface for conducting readings the goal being to only draw from the physical artifacts (the deck of cards) those attributes which are meaningful to the reading: imagery, interpretations, and context. The traditional shuffling, dealing, and arranging of the cards is removed from the process providing a much more streamlined reading experience.

The interpretations are there to help anyone unfamiliar with tarot.  They are a synthesis of my experience and research conducted during development.  My primary research sources include:

The Oracle of the Tarot by Paul Foster Case

Tarot Plain and Simple by Anthony Louis

Learning the Tarot by Joan Bunning

Sex Magic, Tantra, and Tarot by Christopher Hyatt

The deck included is a vintage Rider-Waite deck with artwork by Pamela Coleman Smith, as scanned by Holly Voley
